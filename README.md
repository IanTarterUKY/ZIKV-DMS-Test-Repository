To follow this analysis download the conda environment file "Tyler-escape.yml" and create a conda environment from it. You will also need to download the Snakefile.txt, Config.yml, each of the jupyter notebooks, and set up the directories the same way as is presented here with data, results, scripts folders. To run with your own data edit each data file to correspond to your data samples/names/directories, as well as edit the escape_profiles_config.yml and output_pdbs_config.yml with your respective sample names. 

#This is still a WIP, and not all of the data/results can be uploaded to github due to the file size. The main results, and the outputs from each notebook are present and can be scrolled through without Jupyter Notebook, but you can also launch Jupyter Notebook yourself to run through each notebook individually
